## Full description

DOPPELGÄNGER is more than an installation—it's an experience of deep human connection. Two participants enter a secluding booth and sit across from each other, separated by an unique mirror. As the experience unfolds, the lighting shifts, and the mirror transforms - showing the others face, one's own or a fusion of both. At times, you’ll forget whose face you’re seeing, as your identities begin to blur and merge. It’s a place where the boundary between self and other becomes beautifully, and profoundly, uncertain.

Inside the booth, two sets of headphones provide a curated music experience, perfectly in sync with the rhythm of the lighting and the transformative visuals. The sound helps guide the participants through the journey, enhancing the connection and deepening the emotional experience.

The first time I experienced this, it left an unforgettable impact on me. I watched as my own reflection blurred into another’s, and in that moment, I saw myself in a way I never had before. I wasn’t alone—others around me emerged from the booth in awe, some laughing, some crying, all profoundly moved. That experience has stayed with me, and it’s what drives me to bring DOPPELGÄNGER to Borderland. I want others to feel what I felt—to step inside, to let go of the barriers between us, and to come out changed.

Strangers step into DOPPELGÄNGER with curiosity. It’s a space where barriers dissolve, where we see ourselves in others—sometimes quite literally—and where many have walked out in awe, in laughter, or even having fallen a little bit in love.

Technically the experience works by alternating light-levels on either side of a semi-transparent mirror. By rapidly alternating these levels showing (parts of) either side our sense of self starts to dissolve into the others face. The lights and sound will be pre-programmed and controlled by a microcontroller similar to an arduino.
